            Tyler - 1
            I am an undergraduate senior here at NWMSU majoring in Computer Science. I am graduating this December (if I
            pass all my classes this semester).
            Something interesting about me is that I am an ordained minister. Here is the link to my LinkedIn:

            <h2>Future</h2>
            I am not sure what I will be doing after graduation, I plan on applying to jobs starting next week. I would
            be interested in front end development or possibly software engineering.
