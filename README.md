## About
This repo will be used throughout the semester to add different repo links to and used as a website that employers could come to to see what work I have done.  

## Recommended Tools
This will explain some of the basics of creating a repo. 
1. Have a GitHub account
2. Create a new repo with a README.md file
3. Create an index.txt file
4. Use Markdown to make your README.md useful so users know what the repo is all about
5. Commit changes
6. Make it a GitHub Page in settings so there is a website for the README.md
7. Pull to your machine using git bash and work locally if you would like
8. Make sure to commit and push all wanted changes
